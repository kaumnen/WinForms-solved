### Remember that every pull request has to be reviewed, please be patient.

# Main rules
1. Use comments
 
	*Do not comment every line, or some trivial things. Use common sense, comment things you feel it would be helpful for you in future.*
2. Enforce DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle
 
	*Do not write same stuff again. Reuse existing code. //where applicable*
3. At the beginning of your solution Readme file, state which version of .NET is used (Framework, Core, or latest .NET). Please include version number as well.
4. If solution refers to problem found in **book**, make appropriate folder inside main folder named **BOOK** 
	
	At the top (after .NET version and version number), add page number, and problem numeration as in book, e.g. *2.3*
	
	**Do NOT** post any text or pictures from book, as book is under copyright protection.
	
5. If solution refers to problem found on internet, make appropriate folder inside main folder named **INTERNET**
	At the top (after .NET version and version number), add text, photo of a problem and URL, if applicable
# Step by step

1. Fork the project
 
3. Clone it on your local machine
 
5. Depending on problem origin, make a folder in appropriate *main folder* (BOOK, INTERNET)
 
	4. If problem is from a book, name it after problem num, e.g. 2.1, 2.2 etc.
	 
	6. If problem is from internet, name it after problem name


6. Make a new project from VisualStudio's start window inside that new folder. 

	7. Project name template - `Exercise {numeration}`, e.g. Exercise 2.1
	
	9. Set `Place solution and project in the same directory` field **unchecked**, and set solution name to `WinFormsSolution`

8. Make a pull request, thank you!

## Branch naming advice
For book problems, please use `{problem_num}_{page its on}` e.g. `2.1_08`

For internet problems, please use name of exercise
