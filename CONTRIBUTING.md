👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

### Remember every pull request has to be reviewed, please be patient.

# Main rules
1. Use comments
 
	*Do not comment every line, or some trivial things. Use common sense, comment things you feel it would be helpful for you in future.*
2. Enforce DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle
 
	*Do not write same stuff again. Reuse existing code. //where applicable*
3. At the beginning of your solution Readme file, state which version of .NET is used (Framework, Core, or latest .NET). Please include version as well.
